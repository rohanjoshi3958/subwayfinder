# Subway Finder - Interactive Map with MBTA Integration

A React.js application that displays an interactive map using Leaflet, automatically detects your current location, and finds nearby MBTA subway stations using the [MBTA API](https://api-v3.mbta.com/docs/swagger/index.html#/).

## Features

- üåç Interactive map powered by Leaflet and OpenStreetMap
- üìç Automatic geolocation detection
- üéØ Pin marker showing your current location
- üöá **MBTA Station Integration** - Find nearby subway stations
- üìç **Moveable Pin** - Click anywhere to move the pin and find stations
- üì± Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile
- ‚ö° Real-time location updates
- üõ°Ô∏è Error handling for location services
- üìä **Station Information Panel** - Shows distance in miles, accessibility, and station details
- üìö **Documentation Link** - Easy access to MBTA API documentation directly from the map

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository or navigate to the project directory
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

3. Allow location access when prompted by your browser

4. Click "Show Nearby Stations" to find MBTA stations near your location

### How It Works

- The application uses the browser's Geolocation API to get your current position
- If location access is granted, a pin will be placed on the map at your coordinates
- If location access is denied or unavailable, the map will default to Boston
- **Click anywhere on the map** to move the pin to a new location
- **Click "Show Nearby Stations"** to find MBTA subway stations within 1.25 miles of the pinned location
- **Station markers** appear on the map with distance information in miles and accessibility details
- **Station sidebar** shows a list of nearby stations with distances and features
- **Documentation link** in the top center provides quick access to MBTA API documentation

## MBTA API Integration

This application integrates with the [MBTA API v3](https://api-v3.mbta.com/docs/swagger/index.html#/) to provide:

- **Real-time station data** from the MBTA system
- **Distance calculations** using the Haversine formula (displayed in miles)
- **Station filtering** by proximity (1.25 miles radius)
- **Accessibility information** for wheelchair access
- **Station details** including names and coordinates
- **Caching** for improved performance and reduced API calls

### API Endpoints Used

#### Primary Endpoint: `GET /stops`
**URL**: `https://api-v3.mbta.com/stops`

**Purpose**: Retrieves all MBTA stops (stations) with comprehensive route and accessibility information.

**Parameters Used**:
- `filter[route_type]`: `0,1` - Filters for subway stations only
  - `0` = Light rail (Green Line)
  - `1` = Heavy rail (Red, Orange, Blue Lines)
- `include`: `route` - Includes route relationship data
- `fields[stop]`: `name,latitude,longitude,wheelchair_boarding` - Specifies which stop fields to return
- `fields[route]`: `long_name,short_name,route_type` - Specifies which route fields to return

**Response Structure**:
```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "stop_id",
      "type": "stop",
      "attributes": {
        "name": "Station Name",
        "latitude": 42.123456,
        "longitude": -71.123456,
        "wheelchair_boarding": 1
      },
      "relationships": {
        "route": {
          "data": {
            "id": "route_id",
            "type": "route"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "included": [
    {
      "id": "route_id",
      "type": "route",
      "attributes": {
        "long_name": "Red Line",
        "short_name": "Red",
        "route_type": 1
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Data Processing**:
- **Distance Calculation**: Uses Haversine formula to calculate distance from user's location to each station
- **Filtering**: Only stations within 1.25 miles of the user's location are displayed
- **Caching**: API responses are cached to reduce repeated requests and improve performance
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of API failures with user-friendly error messages

**Rate Limiting**: The MBTA API has rate limits, which is why caching is implemented to minimize API calls.

**Authentication**: This endpoint is publicly accessible and doesn't require an API key, making it ideal for client-side applications.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js** - Frontend framework
- **Leaflet** - Interactive maps library
- **react-leaflet** - React wrapper for Leaflet
- **Geolocation API** - Browser API for location detection
- **OpenStreetMap** - Free map tiles
- **MBTA API v3** - Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority API
- **Haversine Formula** - Distance calculation between coordinates (converted to miles)
- **CSS3** - Modern styling with backdrop filters and smooth transitions

## Browser Compatibility

This application works best in modern browsers that support:
- Geolocation API
- ES6+ JavaScript features
- CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Fetch API for HTTP requests
- Backdrop-filter CSS property (for documentation link styling)

## Troubleshooting

### Location Not Working?
- Make sure you've allowed location access in your browser
- Check that your device has GPS enabled (for mobile devices)
- Try refreshing the page and allowing location access again

### Map Not Loading?
- Check your internet connection
- Ensure you're running the latest version of a modern browser

### Stations Not Loading?
- Verify your internet connection
- Check if the MBTA API is accessible
- Try moving the pin to a different location in the Boston area
- The app searches within a 1.25 miles radius of the pinned location

### No Stations Found?
- The app only shows stations within 1.25 miles of your location
- Try moving the pin closer to Boston or other MBTA service areas
- The app works best in the Greater Boston area where MBTA service is available

## Available Scripts

- `npm start` - Runs the app in development mode
- `npm test` - Launches the test runner
- `npm run build` - Builds the app for production
- `npm run eject` - Ejects from Create React App (one-way operation)
